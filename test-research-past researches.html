From 2009, I worked with Prof. D. Ye (from University of Lorraine-Metz, France) and Prof. F. Zhou (from East China Normal University, P.R. China) to investigate the regularity of extremal solution $u^*$ for semilinear elliptic equation $-\triangle u+c(x)\cdot\nabla u=\lambda f(u)$ on a bounded smooth domain of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with Dirichlet boundary condition. Here, $f$ is a positive nondecreasing convex function, exploding at a finite value $a\in(0,\infty)$. This equation comes from Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), which are used commonly in our daily life, such as accelerometers for air bag deployment, blood pressure sensors, inkjet printer heads, microwave, computer disk drive read/write heads and digital mirrors for high-resolution display. Recently, a mathematical modeling, proposed by Pelesko and Bernstein in 2002, leads to elliptic and parabolic PDEs of second or fourth order, with the source term to be the negative power functions. A simplified model of MEMS device in dimension two is composed by an elastic membrane and fixed metallic plate. The upper surface is a thin deformable membrane with dielectric material, coated with a negligibly thin metallic conducting film. When an electric voltage $V$ is applied to the film, the membrane deflects towards the ground plate. The solution represents the distance between the deflected membrane and the ground plate. We know that there exists a critical voltage, called pull-in voltage $V^*$ such that whenever $V>V^*$, we have no longer steady state deflection position. It is also known that the solution corresponding to $V=V^*$, named the extremal solution $u^*$ does always exist in a weak sense.

So, will the membrane touch down to the ground plate, when $V=V^*$? The answer is negative in dimension two and three, under some mild condition on $f$. From the mathematical point of view, one would like to understand the touch-down phenomena, or mathematically, the regularity of the extremal solution, for a more general setting of source terms and in the higher dimensional domains. We show in [L-Ye-Z] (item 2, in Publications) that the extremal solution is regular in low dimensional case. In particular, we prove that for the radial case, all extremal solutions are regular in dimension two, for any source term with the finite time blow-up property. [L-Ye-Z] has been published in Journal of Differential Equations in 2011.

In the summer of 2007, I attended the summer school held in ECNU. Professor Wei-Ming Ni (from University of Minnesota-Minneapolis) brought a very interesting PDE into our sight. It is so-called Gierer-Meinhardt model, a reaction-diffusion system of the activator-inhibitor type that appears to account for many important types of pattern formation and morphogenesis observed in development. The model describes the concentration of a short-range autocatalytic substance, the activator, that regulates the production of its long-range antagonist, the inhibitor. To fully understand the dynamics of the coupled system of PDE is not easy. As the first step,  W.-M. Ni, K. Suzuki, I. Takagi (JDE, 2006) investigated and clearly portrayed the global dynamics of the kinetic Gierer-Meinhardt systems (the coupled system of ODEs) with zero self-production rate of the activator. It intrigued one's curiosity that how the picture of the systems with a positive self-production rate of the activator will be. Naively, we thought that the dynamics of the system with the zero self-production rate will be the limit as the self-production rate approaching zero. With our dedicated investigation, the situation is far more complicated. In [L-N-X] (item 2, in Preprints), we discovered a few interesting phenomenon, including the existence of limit cycles, finite time blow-up solutions with some initial conditions and also the globally existed solutions, etc. But it is not an easy task to illustrate the whole picture of the trajectories as in the paper of Ni et. al., where the Lyapunov function is fortunately found.
