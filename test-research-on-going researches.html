The filtering problem is a mathematical model for a number of filtering problems in signal processing. The general idea is to form some kind of "best estimate" for the true value of the states of some system, given only some (potentially noisy) historical observations (the measurements of the states). The problem of optimal nonlinear filtering (even for non-stationary case) was investigated by R. L. Stratonovich around 1959, and also by H. J. Kushner. In the late 1960s, Duncan, Mortensen and Zakai introduced a simplified dynamics for the unnormalized conditional law of the filter known as the Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai (DMZ) equation, which mathematically falls into the category of second order linear parabolic equation. So the existence and the uniqueness of the solution, at least in the weak sense, is guaranteed by the standard argument in the theory of PDE. The solution, however, is infinite-dimensional in the general case. So the central problem is to solve the DMZ equation in a real time and memory-less way. In 2008, S.-T. Yau and S. S.-T. Yau proposed an algorithm to solve the DMZ equation in real time in some special case and also rigorously showed convergence of the algorithm under some mild conditions of the drift terms. In 2010, Prof. S. S.-T. Yau (from University of Illinois at Chicago) and I have shown that this algorithm is also valid for the most general DMZ equation under some mild conditions. The convergence in $L^1$ space of this algorithm has also been justified under the similar conditions of the growth rate of the drift terms, which is a reasonable assumption in engineering and industry. These results have been collected in [L-Y2] (item 3, in Preprints) and submitted for publication in 2012. In 2011, to exam the feasibility of our algorithm, we run the numerical simulations for the notorious nonlinear filtering--cubic sensor--in one dimension. The Hermite spectral method is served as the off-line PDE solver. The convergence rate of HSM is investigated in detail in [L-Y1] (item 2, in Preprints) and several technical difficulties have also been reported. Compare our algorithm with nowadays the widely used nonlinear filter--extended Kalman filter, our algorithm is much efficient and accurate. [L-Y1] has been submitted for publication in 2011. A brief summary of our results [L-Y] (item 1, in Publications) has already been accepted to present in 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control in December, 2012.
